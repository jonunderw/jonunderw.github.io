### Backlog before launch
- Update pages with images and non mock content
- Update thumbnail for tab
- Incorporate build time markdown to static content generator.
    -- plan to use mdx package for this
    -- need to setup additional pre-build steps to rename .md to .mdx (additionally, to copy files from Obsidian folder to site folder.)
